          It is my role as the Library Media Specialist to make sure the library
          is welcoming and inviting to all students and staff members. This is
          accomplished through a warm and welcoming atmosphere that offers
          structure but is essentially what I consider --at its best-- the
          “heart” of the school. This is the foundation and driving force behind
          the vision and plan for my school library: the understanding of the
          essential nature of the library program to student achievement and
          success. Developing a library program that shapes my vision requires
          insight into several key components: education and support of
          students, training and support of faculty, cooperation and
          communication with administration, management of the library facility
          and staff, community outreach and advocacy, and continued personal
          professional growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a teacher, I provide access to information rather than being the
          provider of that information. My first goal for the function of the
          library program is to facilitate student education and achievement,
          beginning with literacy. The library should comply with national and
          state standards to be the cornerstone of promoting strong reading
          skills. As a Librarian, I will maintain a diverse and contemporary
          collection of reading materials that will meet the needs and interests
          of all learners in the school. As a Library Media Specialist, I will
          instruct students in research strategies, copyright, and citation use,
          as well as technology skills required to support educational
          activities. It is my job to be knowledgeable about copyright and
          licensure regulations and communicate these regularly and effectively
          to library patrons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The library is also a place for faculty, administration, parents, and
          community members to access information resources. The library is a
          place where students can explore more fully what they are learning in
          the classroom, expand their imagination, unearth subjects that
          interest them, and think clearly, critically, and creatively within
          areas of personal interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students today are submerged in information, all of which differs in
          format, reliability, and means of production. So today’s challenge is
          not in teaching students how to find information, but instead teaching
          them how to be critical of the information they access.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Library Media Specialist, I strive to be a predominant resource
          for faculty in curricular support, collaboration, and co-teaching with
          faculty, particularly in the areas of information literacy, technology
          instruction, library skills, and research, to enhance student learning
          and success. I will also carry out additional research as needed to
          keep resources up-to-date or expand weak areas in the library
          collection. I will assist staff in areas of technology training and
          incorporating technology into instruction as necessary. I will be
          familiar with the common machines and programs used by the school and
          assist with updating, maintaining, repairing and troubleshooting. This
          will include communicating regularly with students and staff library
          updates, programs, achievements and resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of positive change and improvement is one I greatly value.
          Without a deep love of learning, I would not be the person I am today
          -- excited, motivated, and full of hope for the students and staff
          that encompass my surroundings. I am continuously reflecting and
          evaluating my teaching and my work to improve. When something has not
          engaged the students or produced the goal I had hoped, I regroup and
          make a plan to revise it. I enjoy being given the opportunity to seek
          professional development, so I can continuously strive to do my job
          better. I want to show my students that we can make mistakes and not
          be perfect, but that we can always improve and become better. When I
          teach my students to self-evaluate and reflect on their own progress,
          it gives them a chance to take control of their learning and determine
          their own educational direction. I believe all students have the
          inherent need to be respected and heard. My wish for them is that they
          will be open to learning in new ways. When the students can
          collaborate and learn with each other, they have the tools they need
          to make positive changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal as a Library Media Specialist is to foster personal
          exploration, challenge critical thinking, and frame students’
          experiences while forging a conducive learning environment. Multiple
          teaching experiences have taught me that this process only happens if
          students develop a sense of autonomy and accomplishment. My role,
          then, is less about being an expert who dictates content and authority
          and more about being a leader who guides students through learning in
          the context of their lived experiences. My library will be a caring,
          safe, and ethical environment where students will learn to be
          responsible and take ownership of their own learning. I will be a
          responsible leader who models kindness and compassion, uses positive
          discipline, and always strives to create a successful atmosphere for
          all learners. My experience has taught me that not everyone learns in
          the same manner, and I strongly believe the learning process never
          ends, so I make every effort to pass on my devotion to continue
          learning throughout life and share that information with others around
          us.
